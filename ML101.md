## ML101
### What is AI?
- A human intelligence exhibited my machines or a machine that acts like a human
- Narrow AI: Good at only one task
- General AI: machines having multiple abilities 

### What is Machine Learning?
- Science of getting machines to act without being explicity programmed
- Find patterns in a set of data
- Machine learning lets computers make decisions about data. It lets computers learn from data and make predictions and decisions
- In short, machine learning using an algorithm to learn about different patterns in data and using result to make predicitions about the futures using similar data 
- They are also called as models. It's the learning aspect in machine learning that makes it different from normal computer programs
### What is Deep Learning?
- A technique/s to implement machine learning

### Types in machine learning
#### Supervised Learning
- data with labels
- Classification, Regression
#### Unsupervised Learning
- data with no labels
- machines for itself which ones of them in the data form groups
- letting machines create categories
- clustering, association rule learning
#### Reinforcement Learning
- skill acquisition, real time learning
- teaching machines through trial and error or through reward and punishment

## Framework
### Problem definition
#### When shouldn't you use machine learning
- Will a simple hand-coded instruction based system work?
#### Main types of machine learning
- Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Transfer learning, Reinforcement learning
##### Supervised learning
- You have data and labels, machine learning algorithm tries to use the data to predicts the label
- If the guesses the label wrong, the algorithm corrects itself and tries again, acts of correction is why it's called supervised
- Classification: predicts if something is one thing or other, like type of dog breed was in the image
- Binary classifiction = two options, eg: heart disease or not heart disease using previous medical records
- Multi-class classification = more than two options, eg: predicting different dog breeds since many different kinds of dog breeds
- Regression: Trying to predict a number or continuous number
- Trying to predict many people will buy this app, how much will this house sell for? and etc
##### Unsupervised learning
- data with no labels
