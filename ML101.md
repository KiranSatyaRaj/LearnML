## ML101
### What is AI?
- A human intelligence exhibited my machines or a machine that acts like a human
- Narrow AI: Good at only one task
- General AI: machines having multiple abilities 

### What is Machine Learning?
- Science of getting machines to act without being explicity programmed
- Find patterns in a set of data
- Machine learning lets computers make decisions about data. It lets computers learn from data and make predictions and decisions
- In short, machine learning using an algorithm to learn about different patterns in data and using result to make predicitions about the futures using similar data 
- They are also called as models. It's the learning aspect in machine learning that makes it different from normal computer programs
### What is Deep Learning?
- A technique/s to implement machine learning

### Types in machine learning
#### Supervised Learning
- data with labels
- Classification, Regression
#### Unsupervised Learning
- data with no labels
- machines for itself which ones of them in the data form groups
- letting machines create categories
- clustering, association rule learning
#### Reinforcement Learning
- skill acquisition, real time learning
- teaching machines through trial and error or through reward and punishment

## Framework
- This is an iterative process
### Problem definition
#### When shouldn't you use machine learning
- Will a simple hand-coded instruction based system work?
#### Main types of machine learning
- Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Transfer learning, Reinforcement learning
##### Supervised learning
- You have data and labels, machine learning algorithm tries to use the data to predicts the label
- If the guesses the label wrong, the algorithm corrects itself and tries again, acts of correction is why it's called supervised
- Classification: predicts if something is one thing or other, like type of dog breed was in the image
- Binary classifiction = two options, eg: heart disease or not heart disease using previous medical records
- Multi-class classification = more than two options, eg: predicting different dog breeds since many different kinds of dog breeds
- Regression: Trying to predict a number or continuous number
- Trying to predict many people will buy this app, how much will this house sell for? and etc
##### Unsupervised learning
- data with no labels
- Clustering: Putting groups of similar examples together

##### Transfer learning
- Leverages what one machine learning model has learned in another machine learning model
- Like an ML models that predicts different car types in an image,its foundational model can be used in an ML model for identifying differnt dog breed in an image since we have a model which has an idea about what different patterns looks like
##### Reinforcement learning
- Having computer program perform some actions in a defined space and rewarding for doing it well or punishing it not doing properly
- For example, teaching a machine learning model to play chess, its goal is to maximize the score here chess board it the defined space and moving pieces are actions
- In this example, rewarding can be updating the score by +1 if it wins or punishing it by decrementing the score with -1 if it loses

### Data
#### Differnt types of data
- structured: excel sheets, csv files etc
- unstructured: images, videos, audio files, natural language text etc
- static: data doesn't change over time
- streaming: data's updated over time

### Evaluation
- For example, building highly accurate model for predicting whether or a patient has a heart disease
#### Different types of metrics
Classification		Regression		Recommendation
--------------		-----------		---------------
Accuracy		Mean absolute error	Precision at K
Precision		Mean squared error	
Recall			Root mean squared error
### Features
#### Different features of data
- Numerical features, Categorical features
- Feature engineering is looking at different features of data and creating new ones/altering existing ones
### Modelling(Important)
- 3 parts to modelling: 
1. Choosing and training a model
2. Tuning a model
3. Model comparision
- Example: Course materials(training set), Practice exam(validation set), Final exam(test set)
- Generalization: The ability for a machine learning model to perform well on data it hasn't seen before
- For a machine learning to be valuable at predicting something in the future on unseen data avoid your model into memorisation machines
- Example: 100 patient records in total spilt: 70-80% into training split, 10-15% into validation split, 10-15% into test split
- It is important that our machine learning model doesn't see test data split
#### Choosing a model
- Structured data - cat boost, XGBoost, random forest decision tree etc
- Unstrucuted data - deep learning, Transfer learning, neural networks
##### Things to remember
- Some models work better than others on different problems
- Don't be afraid to try things
- Start small and build up (add complexity) as you need
#### Tuning a model
- A model can be tuned for different types of data, usually this take place on validation data. It can also happen on training data
##### Things to remember
- Machine Learning models have hyperparameters(something that is manually specified) you can adjust
- A models first results aren't its last
- Tuning can take on place on validation or training data sets
#### Model comparision
- Seeing how your model adapts to data it hasn't seen before
##### Testing a model
- Overfitting and undefeating or underfitting are both examples of a model not being able to generalize well, performance on test should be slightly lesser than that of training data i.e not too well also not too poorly
- Data leakage: When some of your test data leaks into your training data, this often leads to overfitting or model doing too well on test data
- It is important to do the splits correctly
- Data mismatch - test data is different from training data, such as different featurs in the training data to the test data, this can lead to models performing poorly
- It is important that training and testing are done on same kind of data
##### Fixes for overfitting and underfitting
For Under fitting
- Try a more advanced model
- Increase model hyperparameters
- Reduce amount of features
- Train longer
For Over fitting
- Collect more data
- Try a less advanced mode
##### Things to remember
- Want to avoid overfiting and underfitting (head towards generality)
- Keep tests separate at all costs
- compare apples to apples i.e same kind of data
- One best performance metric doesn't equal best model
